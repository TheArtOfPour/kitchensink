Wondering what to do with those turnips? 
Are those tomatoes about to go bad? 
Just tell Kitchen Sink what ingredients you have and Alexa will offer a list of recipes. 
Pick which one you like and Kitchen Sink will deliver the recipe directly to your phone or tablet through the Alexa app. 
Add and remove ingredients freely and if you happen to be looking for random recipe ideas, just ask Kitchen Sink what you can make without ingredients. 
Bon App√©tit!
